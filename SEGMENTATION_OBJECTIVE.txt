Based on the business scenario of Store X, the project aims to build a customer segmentation system to help the store better understand the shopping behavior of each customer group. By analyzing transaction data and product information, the system will identify different customer segments, ranging from loyal and potential customers to those at risk of churning. Thereby, the store can develop suitable marketing, sales, and customer care strategies, aiming to increase revenue and enhance customer satisfaction.

The proposed solution to achieve this goal is to apply the **RFM model (Recency – Frequency – Monetary)**, a popular method in customer behavior analysis. RFM evaluates customers based on three key criteria: the recency of the last purchase, shopping frequency, and total spending. After assigning RFM scores to each customer, the data will be fed into clustering algorithms like **K-Means** or **Hierarchical Clustering** to divide customers into groups with similar characteristics. This provides the store with a comprehensive picture of its customer structure.

Based on the clustering results, the store can implement specific business solutions. For example, loyal customers can be encouraged through appreciation programs and reward points, while potential customers can be approached with new product campaigns or special offers. Meanwhile, infrequent buyers need attention via win-back promotions to encourage them to return. For high-spending customers, the store can provide exclusive care services to create differentiation and build long-term loyalty.

With this approach, Store X will not only improve marketing efficiency but also build strong relationships with customers, gradually enhancing the shopping experience and reinforcing its competitive advantage in the market.
