`Observation:` The clustering results show that the **“Other”** group accounts for the vast majority of customers (3,759 people), characterized by **low recency** (purchased recently), **moderate frequency**, and **average monetary** value. This indicates that most customers have interacted with the business recently and buy relatively often, but **spending per customer is not yet high**. Meanwhile, other groups like **Dormant Customers**, **Main Customers**, and **Promising Customers** make up only a small share, reflecting that they are niche or potential groups, rather than the current core customer base.

`Observation:` Based on the model comparison chart, the **K-means** method demonstrates superior performance with the **consistently highest silhouette scores** and **lowest SSE values** across most k values. Notably, at **k = 6**, the SSE curve shows an **elbow** point, indicating this is the optimal balance between accuracy and model complexity. Therefore, selecting **K-means with k = 6** is the best choice to divide customers into **6 distinct groups**, achieving the best clustering performance.
