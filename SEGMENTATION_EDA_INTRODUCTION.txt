In the customer segmentation project for Store X, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) plays a crucial role in understanding data characteristics and quality before building models. Through EDA, we can identify shopping trends, spending levels, transaction frequency, and best-selling products, while also detecting and handling missing data or outliers. Additionally, visualizing data through charts helps clarify differences between customer groups, guiding the application of the RFM model and the selection of suitable clustering algorithms. As a result, EDA serves as a vital foundation, ensuring accurate analysis and helping the store build effective customer care strategies.
