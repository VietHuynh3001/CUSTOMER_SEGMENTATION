These are customers with high buying frequency, high spending, and who return often. They are a stable source of revenue and easily accept **upsell** or **cross-sell** offers. The store should focus on introducing new products, combo packages, and reward point policies to increase order value.
These are customers who shop little, spend little, and haven't returned for a long time. They are at risk of forgetting the brand. To reactivate them, the store should run **personalized promotion campaigns**, send discount vouchers, or news about new products to attract them back.
These are customers who buy steadily and spend an average amount. They are not truly loyal yet but keep buying regularly. For this group, the store should **build a basic care program**, encouraging them to become members to gradually upgrade them to loyal or VIP customers.
These are customers who almost never shop anymore; their frequency and spending are very low. This group has little potential for extra revenue. The store should only keep in contact via low-cost channels like email or SMS, avoiding investing too many resources in them.
These are customers with high spending who buy frequently, bringing great value to the store. However, their loyalty is not yet stable. The store should implement **exclusive privilege programs** like private offers, fast delivery services, or gifts to maintain a long-term relationship.
These are the most important customers with very high spending and frequent shopping. They bring the majority of revenue for the store. Therefore, a **special care policy** is needed, such as private account management, invitations to VIP events, or appreciation gifts to retain them and turn them into brand ambassadors.
