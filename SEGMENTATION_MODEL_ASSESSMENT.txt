In Store X's customer segmentation project, two main methods are used to evaluate the solution's effectiveness. First is the **rule-based approach**, which relies on the RFM model to group customers based on pre-defined thresholds. This method is simple, easy to implement, and easy to interpret, but it has limited flexibility. Second is **using Machine Learning**, applying clustering algorithms such as K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering using **scikit-learn** and **PySpark**. To evaluate model performance, metrics like the **Silhouette Score** are used to measure cluster separation and cohesion, while **RMSE** helps check the deviation between the actual data and the model. Combining these two methods ensures the intuitiveness of the rule-based approach while providing the accuracy and scalability of Machine Learning.
