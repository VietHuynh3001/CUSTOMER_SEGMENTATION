
Active Low Spenders "These customers bought recently and buy often, but their spending is low. They are the largest group of active customers. To improve business, we need strategies to encourage them to spend more money per order."
Loyal Customers (Champions) "This is the loyal group. They buy often, recently, and spend a lot. They are very important for revenue and are highly connected to the business. We need to keep them happy with special offers, personal care, and loyalty programs."
Potential High Spenders "These customers bought recently. They don't buy often, but when they do, they spend a high amount. They have great potential for future profit if we care for them properly. We should nurture them to help them buy more often."
At Risk Customers "These customers used to buy often and spend a decent amount, but they have stopped buying recently. They show signs of leaving the brand, so we need to win them back. We should send special offers or news about new products to make them return."
Lost / Inactive Customers "This group hasn't returned for a long time. They rarely bought anything and spent very little. They are almost inactive. We should be careful about marketing to them. It is better to save money and focus resources on other potential groups."

New Customers "This is a completely new group who just made their first small order. We need to make a good first impression so they come back. We should provide welcome offers, discounts for the next order, and product guides to build a long-term relationship."
