`Observation:` Most customers have low daily spending (under 20 currency units), indicating frequent, small purchases. The average spending of 8.5 confirms this. However, a few customers spend significantly more (up to 85.5), representing a special high-value group. Overall, the customer base is segmented: the majority spends low amounts stably, while a small group spends very high amounts, making them key targets for marketing strategies.
`Observation:` The best-selling items are daily essentials like fresh milk, vegetables, bread, yogurt, and beverages, reflecting customers' familiar consumption habits.
`Observation:` By category, fresh food, milk, and beverages are the most popular, showing high and stable demand for daily food and drink products.
`Observation:` **With full data (including outliers):** The Recency histogram is right-skewed. Most customers bought recently, while a few haven't returned for a long time. These outliers extend the tail, indicating "dormant" or low-engagement customers. **After removing outliers:** The distribution becomes more concentrated, confirming that most customers buy recently and frequently. This shows that the main consumption behavior is positive, with only a small percentage needing reactivation.
`Observation:` The Frequency histogram is right-skewed, and the boxplot shows outliers. Generally, most customers buy at an average level (5–15 times), while a small group buys very frequently, showing outstanding loyalty.

`Observation:` Monetary data shows most customers spend under 100, while a small group spends over 200. This creates a clear difference between regular customers and high-value customers.
