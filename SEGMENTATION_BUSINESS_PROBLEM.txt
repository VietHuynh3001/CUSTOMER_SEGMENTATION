Store X is a shop that sells daily essential goods like vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, eggs, milk, and drinks. The main customers are individual shoppers who frequently come to buy necessities for their families. However, the market is becoming very competitive, and Store X is facing some business challenges.

The owner wants to sell more products and increase revenue. One major challenge is reaching the right potential customers because different groups of people have different needs and shopping habits. Also, customer care after the sale is not a priority yet, so the shopping experience is not very different from other stores.

The problem for Store X is to find a suitable business strategy. They need to promote products to the right customers and improve customer service. This will help the store keep old customers and attract new ones, leading to more sales and happy customers.
